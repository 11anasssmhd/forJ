# Assets Folder

This folder is where you can add optional images and sounds to enhance the experience.

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
assets/
├── images/        (optional background images, icons, etc.)
└── sounds/        (optional sound effects and music)
```

## 🎵 Recommended Sounds (Optional)

If you want to add sounds, place them in the `sounds/` folder with these names:

### For Landing Page (index.html):
- `background-music.mp3` - Soft romantic background music
- `hover.mp3` - Button hover sound effect

### For Game (game.html):
- `collect.mp3` - Sound when collecting a heart (short, pleasant "ding" or "pop")
- `win.mp3` - Victory sound when reaching 10 hearts
- `romantic-music.mp3` - Romantic music that plays after saying "Yes"

## 🎨 Optional Images

You can add custom images to the `images/` folder:
- Custom background patterns
- Character sprites
- Additional decorative elements

## 💡 Notes

- All sounds are **optional** - the site works perfectly without them
- Sound code is already in place but commented out
- To enable sounds, simply add the audio files and uncomment the relevant code sections
- Recommended audio formats: MP3 (best compatibility)
- Keep audio files small for faster loading (< 1MB recommended)
